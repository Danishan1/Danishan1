# Welcome to Danishan's Portfolio!

I am **Danishan**, currently serving as a **Technical Project Lead** at **JKC Software** and the **Founder & Technical Architect** at **itsRIGHTtime** (pre-launch). I lead the end-to-end development of scalable software products — from system design to code delivery — across diverse domains like **EdTech**, **DesignTech**, and **Cybersecurity**. I specialize in **Node.js** and **C++** — designing scalable web systems and backend architectures.
